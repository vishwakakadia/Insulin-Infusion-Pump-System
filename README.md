# Insulin-Infusion-Pump-System
Safety Critical System for infusion insulin system
For the insulin-Glucagon Infusion pump system,creating simulation(Using Matlab).This is work based on the dynamic approach. The overall approach for the insulin Glucagon infusion system is that data fetch manually and process the data using Bergman mathematical model. And it gives you visual interpretation of glucose and insulin rate that how much glucose in the patients body and how much we have to inject as an insulin. There are two conditions like if patients glucose level is less then 80 its called Hypoglycemia at that time alarm gives an alert and stop the process. after that gives the suggestion of food intake and medicine so this is the not that much critical phase so its handle by the internal staff. second condition is that glucose level is more then 180 its called Hyperglycemia. In this situation system immediately stop and gives an alert to called a doctor. This situation is really critical so its only handle by the professionals. In every time interval data will be automatically measured.

## Mathematical Model


The Bergman minimal model can be represented mathematically using
a set of differential equations. Here is a simplified mathematical represen-
tation of the Bergman model for insulin and glucose dynamics
